                        We developed this project to book a car on rent at the fare charges. In present system all booking work 
                        done manually and it takes very hard work to maintain the information of booking and cars. 
                        If you want to find which vehicle is available for booking then it takes a lot of time.
                         It only makes the process more difficult and hard. This aim of the project is to automate 
                         the work performed in the car rental management system like generating daily bookings, 
                         records of car or cab available for booking, record of routes available, rental charges for cars for 
                         every rout, store record of the customer. this is a project for car rental website made by Deepak Kumar from where you can take a car on rent.
